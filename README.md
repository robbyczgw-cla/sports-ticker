## 🤖 OpenClaw Integration

### Automatic Cron Setup

The easiest way to set up match-day alerts is with the setup script:

```bash
# Generate cron job configurations (outputs JSON for agent to use)
python3 scripts/setup_crons.py <telegram_id> <timezone>

# Example
python3 scripts/setup_crons.py 123456789 "Europe/London"
python3 scripts/setup_crons.py 123456789 "America/New_York"

# Just view the example cron configs
python3 scripts/setup_crons.py --list
```

> **Note (v3.0.5):** The script outputs JSON configurations that the agent applies via `openclaw automations`. It does NOT create crons directly — the agent handles that via platform tools.

This generates 3 cron job configs:

| Cron Job | Schedule | Purpose |
|----------|----------|---------|
| `football-match-check` | Daily 9 AM | Checks if your teams play today |
| `spurs-live-ticker` | Every 2 mins (disabled) | Live updates during matches |
| `spurs-reminder` | Dynamic (disabled) | 30-min pre-match reminder |

### How Auto-Scheduling Works

1. **Morning check** — `football-match-check` runs at 9 AM daily
2. **Match found?** — If any team plays today, it:
   - Updates `spurs-live-ticker` to start 5 mins before kickoff
   - Sets `spurs-reminder` for 30 mins before kickoff
   - Enables both crons
3. **During match** — `spurs-live-ticker` runs every 2 mins, sending goals/cards/events
4. **No match?** — Both crons stay disabled (no spam!)

### Manual Cron Setup

If you prefer manual setup, here are the cron expressions:

```bash
# Daily match check at 9 AM
0 9 * * *    # football-match-check

# Live ticker every 2 minutes (enable only during matches)
*/2 * * * *  # spurs-live-ticker

# Pre-match reminder (set to 30 mins before kickoff)
30 14 * * *  # spurs-reminder (example: 2:30 PM for 3 PM kickoff)
```

### Cron Payload Examples

**Match Check (daily):**
```json
{
  "message": "Check if any configured teams play today. If a match is found, update spurs-live-ticker to start 5 mins before kickoff and run for 3 hours. Enable spurs-reminder for 30 mins before kickoff."
}
```

**Live Ticker (during matches):**
```json
{
  "message": "Run python3 scripts/live_monitor.py and send any new events (goals, cards, halftime, fulltime). Only message if there are updates."
}
```

### OpenClaw 2.0 Notes

- The primary CLI command is `openclaw automations`. The old name `openclaw cron` still works as an alias.
- The wake flag is `--wake`. There is no `--wake-mode` flag in 2.0.
- Exec in automations requires an approval grant in 2.0. The ticker automations run `python3 scripts/live_monitor.py` via exec; without an approved grant they fail silently. Grant approvals through the Control UI — without it, there is no error message.

### Live Monitor Script

During matches, run every 2 minutes:
```bash
python3 scripts/live_monitor.py
```

The script only outputs when there are new events (goals, cards, etc.), making it perfect for cron-based alerting.

## 🔧 Scripts Reference

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `ticker.py` | Show current status of your teams |
| `live_monitor.py` | Check for live updates (for cron) |
| `schedule.py` | 📅 View upcoming fixtures (v3) |
| `auto_setup_crons.py` | 🤖 Generate match crons (v3) |
| `espn.py` | Direct ESPN API access |
| `setup.py` | Interactive setup wizard |
| `config.py` | Configuration management |

## 📅 Schedule & Auto-Crons (v3 Feature)

### The Problem (v2)
The old scoreboard-only approach meant:
- Only TODAY's matches were visible
- If your daily cron didn't run, you'd miss matches
- No advance notice of upcoming fixtures

### The Solution (v3)
**Schedule API** scans future dates to find your team's fixtures:

```bash
# See what's coming up
python3 scripts/schedule.py --team spurs --days 30

# Output:
# 🐓 Tottenham Hotspur - Upcoming Fixtures
# 📅 Sat 07 Feb 12:30 UTC | @ Man United (Premier League)
#    📍 Old Trafford
# 📅 Tue 10 Feb 19:30 UTC | vs Newcastle (Premier League)
#    📍 Tottenham Hotspur Stadium
```

**Auto-Cron Generator** creates match-day cron job configs:

```bash
python3 scripts/auto_setup_crons.py --team spurs --days 14

# Outputs JSON configs for:
# ✅ spurs-reminder-2026-02-07 (30 mins before kickoff)
# ✅ spurs-ticker-start-2026-02-07 (starts monitoring)
# ⏸ spurs-ticker-2026-02-07 (every 2 mins during match)
```

> **Note (v3.0.5):** The script outputs JSON configurations instead of CLI commands. The agent processes these JSON configs and creates the automations via `openclaw automations`.

### Workflow
1. Run `schedule.py` weekly to see upcoming fixtures
2. Run `auto_setup_crons.py` to generate cron configs (JSON output)
3. Agent processes the JSON and creates the automations via `openclaw automations`
4. Never miss a match again! 🎉
